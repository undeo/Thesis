\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:expsetup}
To be able to perform searches for new physics, particle collision at highest scales have to be analysed. The most advanced particle accelerator up to date is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which currently operates at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}= 13$\,TeV. The particle collisions are recorded with four detectors, each maintained and operated by a different collaboration. The efforts of thousands of people working either at maintaining the accelerator and detectors or analysing the data have led to an improved understanding of the SM, most prominently with the discovery of a Higgs-like boson in 2012 \cite{cms_higgsdiscov,atlas_higgsdiscov}. The next goal of the LHC is to find proof of new physics that is not yet included in the SM, for which evidence has already been found (section~\ref{sec:aTGC}).\\

\noindent The following chapter outlines the Large Hadron Collider and the Compact Muon Solenoid, which provided the data used in this analysis. All information about the LHC are taken from \cite{lhc_machine}, while the information about CMS are taken from \cite{CMS_design,strip_fig}, if not stated otherwise.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider is a synchrotron particle collider located in Geneva, Switzerland, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is built 100\,m below the surface inside the tunnel of its predecessor, the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), and has a circumference of 26.7\,km. In contrast to LEP, in the LHC protons are accelerated. Two separate beam lines are needed for the LHC to accelerate protons in opposite directions. It started operating in 2010 at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV. After several improvements were installed in a shut down period, it restarted operating at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, which is slightly below its design energy of 14\,TeV. The LHC has a second operation mode, where heavy ions are collided. Although the single nuclei of the ions have a smaller center of mass energy than in the proton-proton mode, heavy ion collision might give insight on different physical aspects, like the quark-gluon plasma.\\

\noindent Each of the proton beams is divided into 2808 bunches with a bunch spacing of 25\,ns. Before a proton beam can be inserted into the beam lines it has to be pre-accelerated by several smaller accelerators, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:lhc}. To finally reach the current peak center of mass energy of 13\,TeV, a superconducting cavity system operating at 400\,MHz is used. With this setup a luminosity of the order of $10^{34}\,\rm{cm}^2\rm{s}^{-1}$ is reached, resulting in an average of 25 collisions per bunch crossing. This so-called pileup is an additional challenge for analysing the data, where particles from additional collisions have to be removed from the main event.\\

\end{figure}

\noindent An ultra high vacuum is needed inside the beam lines to avoid scattering on gas molecules. A total of 1232 dipol magnets are used to keep the particle beams on their track. These magnets are given by superconducting coils cooled down to 2\,K using liquid helium, providing a magnetic field of up to 8.33\,T. Additionaly, 392 quadrupole magnets are installed to keep the beam focused. Higher order perturbations and are corrected for with sextupole, octupole and decapole magnets.\\

\noindent There are eight collision points along the beam with a detector positioned at four of them. The LHCb detector is a forward detector designed for high precision measurements in the bottom and charm quark physics \cite{LHCB}. The ALICE detector is specialized on heavy ion collisions \cite{ALICE}. The two multi purpose detectors CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and ATLAS (A Toridal LHC Apparatus) were designed for the search of the Higgs boson, searches for new physics and the measurement of SM properties.\\

\noindent [FUTURE PLANS?]

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment}
The CMS detector is one of two multi-purpose detectors at the LHC. It provided the data used in this analysis. With a length of 21.6\,m and a diameter of 14.6\,m it is not the tallest but the heaviest detector at the LHC, weighing 12.5\,t.
The CMS detector is made up of several subdetectors, each designed for measuring specific kinematic properties of different particles. Closest to the collision point is the silicon tracker, which measures the tracks of charged particles. Electrons, Positrons and Photons then deposit all of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter surrounding the tracker, while hadrons hadronize in the hadron calorimeter. The calorimeters are surrounded by the superconducting solenoid, which provides the magnetic field needed for the momentum measurement with the tracker. The outermost layers consist of alternating iron return yokes for the magnetic field and muon chambers. In the following section the different subdetectors of CMS are shortly portrayed.\\

	\label{fig:expsetup:cms_slice}
\end{figure}

\noindent The most common coordinates used when describing cylindrical detectors like CMS are the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and the rapidity $y$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z} \right) ~,
\end{equation}
where $E$ denotes the particle energy and $p_z$ the particle momentum in beam direction. For massless particles or in the relativistic case the rapidity is equal to the pseudorapidity $\eta$, which can be written as
\begin{equation}
\eta = -\ln \left( \tan \frac{\theta}{2} \right) ~,
\end{equation}
with the polar angle $\theta$ with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction. Another used coordinate is the radius $r$, which is given as the distance from the beam line.
\subsection*{Silicon Tracker}

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../plots/expsetup/pixel.png}
	\caption[Schematic view of the CMS pixel detector]{Schematic view of the CMS pixel detector, taken from \cite{CMS_design}. It consists of three layers in the barrel region (green) and two endcaps on each side.}
	\label{fig:expsetup:pixel}
\end{figure}
To be able to reconstruct the collision vertices and estimate the charge and momentum of the produced particles, their tracks have to be reconstructed. Therefore, the tracking system is built closely around the interaction point, consisting of a pixel and a strip detector. Charged particles propagating through the semiconducting pixels and strips of the tracker create electron-hole pairs. They are accelerated by an applied voltage, leading to measurable electric signals. The particle tracks can be reconstructed from the hits in different pixels or strips using the reconstruction algorithms described in section~\ref{sec:trackreco}.\\

\noindent A good resolution in the track reconstruction is essential for the collision vertex reconstruction, especially for the identification of secondary vertices used in the reconstruction of b quarks. Therefore, closest to the interaction point, where the particle flux is highest, the silicon pixel detector consisting of around 65 million pixels is used. It provides the needed granularity to resolve the high amount of events expected due to the average of 25 collision per bunch crossing. Each pixel has a size of 100x150\,$\upmu$m$^2$, leading to a spatial resolution of 10\,$\upmu$m for the $r$-$\phi$-measurement and 20\,$\upmu$m for the $z$-measurement. They are arranged in a barrel of three layers with two end cap discs on each side, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:pixel}.\\

\noindent Due to the decreased particle flux in the region around the pixel detector, a silicon strip detector provides a sufficient resolution. It also consists of a barrel and two end caps, which are divided into two parts each: the Tracker Inner Barrel (TIB), the Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB), the Tracker Inner Discs (TID) and the Tracker End Caps (TEC) as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:strip}. The modules of the first two layers of the TIB and the TID as well as three of the TEC rings are arranged with an angle to each other, providing stereo measurement in the $r$-$\phi$ and $y$ direction. A resolution of 23-52\,$\upmu$m is reached both in the $r$-$\phi$ and $y$ direction.

Further in $z$ direction are the endcaps (TID and TEC).}
    \label{fig:expsetup:strip}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
To identify electrons, positrons and photons the electromagnetic calorimeter is built around the tracker. Electrons and positrons deposit their energy in the calorimeter through emission of bremsstrahlung and scattering, while photons produce electron-positron-pairs. The hereby produced lower-energetic secondary particles again interact with the calorimeter, resulting in a particle shower. By measuring the energy of these particle showers using scintillators, the energy of the primary particles can be reconstructed.\\

\noindent The electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS detector consists of 75848 lead tungstate (PbWO$_4$) crystals arranged in a barrel region and two endcaps as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:ecal}. Lead tungstate crystals have a short radiation length of $X_0=0.89$\,cm and are radiation hard. They are used both as absorber and scintillator, allowing for a very compact design. With a length of 23\,cm or about 26 $X_0$ the crystalls are expected to absorb almost all energy of   Due to their relatively low scintillation light yield amplifying photodiodes are needed to increase the sensitivity. In the barrel region, avalanche photodiodes are installed, while in the endcap vacuum photodiodes are used. A preshower detector is installed in front of the endcaps to be able to distinguish photons originating from actual collisions and photon coming from the decay of $\phi^0$ mesons. It consists of two planes of silicon strip detectors lying behind a lead absorber.

Shown are the barrel section (EB), covering $|\eta|<1.479$, and the endcap (EE), covering $1.653<|\eta|<3.0$. The preshower detector (ES) is used to identify photons coming from $\pi^0$ decays.}
    \label{fig:expsetup:ecal}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Hadron Calorimeter}
Due to their relatively high mass, baryons and mesons do not emit a significant amount of bremsstrahlung and can therefore not be detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter. However, they also create particle showers induced by inelastic scatterings with the detector material. Since QCD interactions are involved, also neutral hadrons can be detected.\\

\noindent The hadron calorimeter consists of alternating layers of brass as absorber material and plastic scintillators. They are arranged in four different sections as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:hcal}. The Hadron Barrel (HB) and the Hadron Endcap (HE) are both located inside the superconducting coil with the HB covering $|\eta|<1.4$ and the HF covering $1.3<|\eta|<3.0$. Outside the coil the Hadron Outer (HO) detector is located to catch any particles passing the solenoid, which functions as additional absorber material. The Hadron Forward (HF) detector further increases the coverage up to $|\eta|<5.0$.

	\label{fig:expsetup:hcal}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Muon System}
Due to their high mass compared to electrons, muons do not emit as much bremsstrahlung and therefore do not shower up in the electromagnetic calorimeter. They propagate through the calorimeter system and the superconducting coil without significant interactions and reach the muon systems in the outermost layers of the CMS detector. Muon candidates can then be reconstructed by combining the hits in the silicon tracker and the hits in the muon system.\\

\noindent The muon system consist of three different gaseous detectors arranged as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expsetup:muonsys}. In the barrel region at $|\eta|<1.2$, where the muon rate is expected to be low, 250 drift tube chambers (DT) organized in 4 layers are used. 
In the endcap regions, where the muon flux is expected to be high, cathode strip chambers (CSC) are installed.
To further improve the measurement, resistive plate chambers are installed in the barrel region and between the DT and CSC.

    \label{fig:expsetup:muonsys}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Trigger System}
The collision rate of 40\,MHz (corresponding to a bunch crossing interval of 25\,ns) and the resulting huge amount of data make it impossible to extract and store every event. Since the interesting physical processes are expected to occur at much lower rates, most of the events are considered as background. Therefore, a pre-selection of events is performed. The measured data of each event is stored for 3.2\,$\upmu$s in a buffer and only processed further if two levels of the triggers are passed\cite{}. The Level 1 trigger (L1) \cite{} rejects events on hardware level based on several requirements, including energy deposits in the calorimeters or hits in the muon system. The L1 reduces the rate of forwarded data to the order of 100\,kHz. The subsequent High Level Trigger (HLT) further reduces the forwarded event rate by a factor of $10^3$ by analysing the data and reconstructing events via software on a processor farm. To keep the needed processing time low only a minimum amount of detector information is used for the reconstruction. This leads to a final event rate of the order of 100\,Hz.
\subsection*{Computing}
The event rate of 100\,Hz after applying the trigger system is still too high to be processed and stored by the infrastructure available at CERN. Therefore, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) was developed, allowing to distribute the data to computer farms all over the world. It is organized in several Tiers as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fix:expsetup:computing}. Tier-0 denotes the computer infrastructure directly at CERN, where the recorded raw data is stored. It is then distributed to the Tier-1 centres, one of them being the GridKA located at the KIT. The events are again reconstructed here and can be accessed by any Tier-2 center, which are located at universities and scientific institutes, providing additional storage capacities and computational power needed for the final analyses.
