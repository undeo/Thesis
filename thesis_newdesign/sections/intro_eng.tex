\chapter*{Introduction}
Being developed between 1960 and 1970, the Standard Model of particle physics is still the most succesful theory describing particles and their interactions. It combines the three fundamental forces given by of the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong force into one consistent theory. It has been confirmed countless of times, most recently with the detection of the infamous Higgs boson, and its parameters have been measured with ever increasing accuracy. 

Albeit its succes and [??], there are [things] that are not covered by the Standard Model, like the forth fundamental force of gravity, which appears to be much weaker than the three other forces (also known as the hierachy problem). Additionally, experimental evidence in cosmology points to the existence of a new form of matter, the so-called dark matter, that only interacts via gravity and possibly the weak force. 
The fact that no

The [?detection] of evidence of physics that is not described by the Standard Model, so-called physics beyond the Standard Model, has open a [?complete] new

\begin{itemize}
\item{LHC, CMS}\\
largest machine ever bulid, most powerful collider, combined effort of thousands of scientist and engineers, Run I&II
The largest and most powerful particle collider up to date is the Large Hadron Collider. It started operating in 20[??] at a center of mass energy of 7\,TeV, collecting enough data for the discovery of the Higgs boson. 
reaching a center of mass energy of 13\,TeV.

rare at LHC, EWK sector
The increased center of mass energy enhances the [production] of rare processes like the diboson production, where two electroweak gauge boson are [produced]. The diboson production is sensitive

semileptonic->high branching ratio

The two boson can either decay into 
Depending on the decay of the two bosons, different channels are defined. 
The analysis described in this thesis focusses on the semileptonic channel, which offers a higher branching fraction compared to the all leptonic channel but smaller background contributions than the all hadronic channel. The event signature of the semileptonic channel [contains] one lepton from the leptonically decaying W boson and two particle showers from the hadronically decaying W or Z boson. Since the sensitivity to anomalous couplings is expected to be highest at high transverse momenta ($p_{\rm T}$), only events with high $p_{\rm T}$ are considered. This leads to an overlapping of the two particle showers
