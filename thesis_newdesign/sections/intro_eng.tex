\chapter*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
Being developed between 1960 and 1970, the Standard Model of particle physics is still the most succesful theory describing particles and their interactions. It combines the theories of the electroweak and the strong force
\item SM\\
developed in 19XX, combines forces, confirmed many times, last predicted particle detected

\item BSM\\
SM not complete (gravity), evidence found (dark matter)

\item LHC, CMS\\
largest machine ever bulid, most powerful collider, scombined effort of thousands of scientist and engineers, Run I&II

\item WW,WZ\\
rare at LHC, EWK sector

\item aTGC\\
new physics might show up in EWK sector, EWK is sensitive at high scales EFT, other analyses
semileptonic->high branching ratio
more data->new methods (substructure needed for merged bossted jets)

\item content\\
\dots
\end{itemize}
