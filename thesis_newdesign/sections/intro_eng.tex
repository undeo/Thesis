\chapter*{Introduction}
Being developed between 1960 and 1970, the Standard Model of particle physics is still the most succesful theory describing particles and their interactions. It combines the three fundamental forces given by of the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong force into one consistent theory. It has been confirmed countless of times, most recently with the detection of the Higgs boson, and its parameters have been measured with ever increasing accuracy. 

The [?detection] of evidence of physics that is not described by the Standard Model, so-called physics beyond the Standard Model, has open a [?complete] new 
using experiments like the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most powerful particle accelerator up to date.

Albeit its succes and [??], there are [things] that are not covered by the Standard Model, like the forth fundamental force of gravity, which appears to be much weaker than the three other forces (also known as the hierachy problem). Additionally, experimental evidence in cosmology points to the existence of a new form of matter, the so-called dark matter, that only interacts via gravity and possibly the weak force.
--higgs predicted --notcomplete
\begin{itemize}

\item{SM}\\
developed in 19XX, combines forces, confirmed many times, last predicted particle detected

\item{BSM}\\
SM not complete (gravity), evidence found (dark matter)

\item{LHC, CMS}\\
largest machine ever bulid, most powerful collider, combined effort of thousands of scientist and engineers, Run I&II

\item{WW,WZ}\\
rare at LHC, EWK sector

\item{aTGC}\\
new physics might show up in EWK sector, EWK is sensitive at high scales EFT, other analyses
semileptonic->high branching ratio
more data->new methods (substructure needed for merged bossted jets)

\item{content}\\
\dots
\end{itemize}
