\section{Monte Carlo Samples}
\dots \\
For each aTGC parameter two working points are defined, which are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:signal:aTGCpoints}. The MC samples for these working points are obtained by reweighting the originally created samples.

\section{WW- and WZ-category}
The signal process under consideration contains both WW and WZ events, which are expected to have a peaking distribution in the \Mpr -spectrum at the W or the Z mass, respectively. Due to the limited resolution of the hadronic calorimeter, those two peaks cannot be easily distinguished. However, if the signal region is divided into a low-mass- ($\Mpr \in [65,85]\,{\rm GeV}$) and a high-mass-region ($\Mpr \in [85,105]\,{\rm GeV}$), their compositions differ significantly, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:signal:wwwz_comp}. While the low-mass-region contains most of the WW-events and some WZ-events with low \Mpr \ , the high-mass-region contains most of the WZ-events and some WW-events with high \Mpr .\\

The division of the signal region provides some sensitivity to different aTGC scenarios. Two of the aTGC parameters, $c_{WWW}$ and $c_W$, enhance the WW and WZ production roughly equally. However, $c_B$ almost exclusively contributes to WW-events. This leads to differentiation power between two scenarios. In the first one, only $c_B$ is unequal to zero, which would result in a larger enhancement and thus in looser limits in the WW-category. In the second scenario, only $c_{WWW}$ and $c_W$ are unequal to zero, leading to roughly similar limits in both categories.
\section{Normalization and Shape of the aTGC Contribution}
The signal function is given by an analytical function depending on the three aTGC parameters. This allows for different scenarios, where either one, two or three aTGC parameters are unequal to zero.\\
The final normalization of the SM diboson process is taken from the NLO MC sample. The normalization of the aTGC contribution is then obtained by applying a scaling factor that is extracted from the LO signal MC signal sample.



The signal function depends on all three aTGC parameters, allowing for a continuous description of the signal process for 
s designed to describe the SM diboson production when all aTGC parameters are set to zero. The function depend The shape of the signal function in the \MWV -spectrum is extracted from the aTGC MC samples. 




For the final limit extraction the normalizations of the anomalous coupling contributions have to be parametrized depending on the three aTGC parameters \cwww ,\ccw \ and \cb . The SM diboson contribution is normalized to its cross section. The aTGC contribution is then added via a scaling factor. Since the event yields scale quadratically in the aTGC parameters, the scaling factor is defined as
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm aTGC} = 1 + \left[ \Delta f_1(c_{WWW}) + \Delta f_2(c_{W}) + \Delta f_3(c_B) \right] ~,
\end{equation}
where the $\Delta f_i$ are given by
\begin{align}
\Delta f_i(x) &= f_i(x)-1 ~, \\
f_i(x) &= a_i + b_i x + d_i x^2 ~. \label{eq:signal:scale}
\end{align}
The functions $f_i(x)$ describe the relative increase in event yields for each aTGC parameter. This definition ensures $S_{\rm aTGC}=1$ for the SM case. The parameters of these functions are extracted from fits to the normalized aTGC yields for the different working points as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:signal:atgcyields_mu} for the muon channel (see Fig.~\ref{fig:app:atgcyields_el} for the electron channel).

\end{figure}
As can be seen here, the yields for positive and negative aTGC parameter values differ, which is caused by interference effects between the aTGC and the SM contribution. This is taken into account by the linear terms in eq.~\ref{eq:signal:scale}.
