\section{WW- and WZ-category}
The signal process under consideration contains both WW and WZ events, which are expected to have a peaking distribution in the \Mpr -spectrum at the W or the Z mass, respectively. Due to the limited resolution of the hadronic calorimeter those two peaks cannot be easily distinguished. However, if the signal region is divided into a low-mass- ($\Mpr \in [65,85]\,{\rm GeV}$) and a high-mass-region ($\Mpr \in [85,105]\,{\rm GeV}$), their compositions differ significantly. While the low-mass-region contains most of the WW-events and some WZ-events with low \Mpr \ , the high-mass-region contains most of the WZ-events and some WW-events with high \Mpr .\\
The division of the signal region provides some sensitivity to different aTGC scenarios. Two of the aTGC parameters, $c_{WWW}$ and $c_W$, enhance the WW and WZ production roughly equally. However, $c_B$ almost exclusively contributes to WW-events.
