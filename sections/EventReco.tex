\section{Event Simulation}
\label{sec:MC}
To be able to make reliable predictions about the events, precise simulation of the involved physical processes, like the scattering or the hadronization, as well as the detector response are needed. For this, different Monte Carlo event generators are used for the different processes relevant in this analysis.
\dots \\
The signal process is simulated in leading order using the \textsc{MadGraph\textunderscore aMC@NLO} event generator with the \textit{EWDim6} model\cite{madgraph}, which implements anomalous couplings based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach that is described in section~\ref{}. Different strenghts of the anomalous couplings are generated by reweighting the originally generated samples according to several working points as specified in chapter~\ref{signal}.\\
