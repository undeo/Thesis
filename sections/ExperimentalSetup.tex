\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap::ExperimentalSetup}
To be able to perform searches for new physics, particle collision at highest scales have to be analysed. The currently most advanced particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider, which is designed for a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}= 14$\,TeV. The particle collisions are recorded with two multy-purpose detectors, the Compact Muon Solenoid and the A Toroidal LHC Apparatus (ATLAS), a detector optimized for b-physics (LHCb) and a detector for heavy ion collisions (ALICE). The efforts of thousands of people working either at maintaining the accelerator and detectors or analysing the data have led to an improved understanding of the SM, most prominently with the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 \cite{cms_higgsdiscov,atlas_higgsdiscov}. The next goal of the LHC is to find proof of new physics that is not yet included in the SM, for which evidence has already been found (section~\ref{sec:aTGC}).\\

\noindent The following chapter outlines the Large Hadron Collider and the Compact Muon Solenoid, which provided the data used in this analysis. All information about the LHC are taken from \cite{lhc_machine}, while the information about CMS are taken from \cite{CMS}, if not stated otherwise.
\section{The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)}
The Large Hadron Collider is a synchrotron collider located in Geneva, Switzerland, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is build inside the tunnel of its predecessor, the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), and has a circumference of 26.7\,km. It started operating in 2010 at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV. After several improvements were installed in a shut down period, it restarted operating at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, which is slightly below its design energy.


In contrast to LEP, in the LHC protons are accelerated. Two separate beam lines are needed for the LHC to accelerate protons in opposite directions.



 Each proton beam is divided into 2808 bunches with a bunch spacing of 25\,ns. Before a proton beam can be inserted into the beam lines it has to be pre-accelerated by several smaller accelerators, as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:expsetup:lhc}. To finally reach the current peak center of mass energy of 13\,TeV, a superconducting cavity system operating at 400\,MHz is used. With this setup a luminosity of the order of $10^{34}\,\rm{cm}^2\rm{s}$ is reached. This results in an average of more than 21 collisions per bunch crossing. This so-called pileup is an additional challenge for analysing the data, where particles from additional collisions have to be removed from the main event.\\

\noindent A total of 1232 dipol magnets are used to keep the particle beams on their track. These magnets are given by superconducting coils cooled down to 2\,K, providing a magnetic field of up to 8.33\,T. About 4800 corrector magnets focus the beams and correct for higher order perturbations. Due to space limitations, a \textit{twin-bore} design is used for the magnets

The LHC can also be operated with heavy ions. 
\noindent 

There are eight collision points (Point 1-8) along the beam with a detector positioned at four of them. The LHCb detector is a forward detector designed for high precision measurements in the B-sector \cite{LHCB}. The ALICE detector is

The CMS detector is one of two multi-purpose detectors at the LHC.
